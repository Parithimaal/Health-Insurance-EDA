## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze health insurance data and explore trends related to premiums, policyholders, and various demographic factors. The analysis uses **interactive visualizations** to gain insights into the dataset and understand relationships between key variables.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of information related to health insurance policies, including:

- **Age**: Age of the insured individual.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, which impacts health risks.
- **Smoking Status**: Whether the individual is a smoker or non-smoker.
- **Region**: The geographical region of the policyholder.
- **Charges**: The insurance cost for each individual.
- **Number of Dependents**: Number of individuals covered under the policy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis focuses on:

1. **Distribution of Charges**: Understanding the variation in insurance costs.
2. **Impact of Smoking on Charges**: Exploring how smoking status affects insurance premiums.
3. **Effect of BMI on Charges**: Identifying the correlation between BMI and insurance costs.
4. **Age vs. Charges Relationship**: Examining how insurance charges vary by age.
5. **Regional Differences**: Comparing charges across different geographical regions.

## Key Insights

- **Smoking has a significant impact** on insurance charges, with smokers paying considerably higher premiums.
- **Higher BMI** is correlated with increased insurance costs.
- **Age** plays a crucial role in determining charges, with older individuals generally paying more.
- **Regional variations exist**, with some areas having higher average charges than others.

## Visualizations

This project utilizes **Plotly** to create interactive charts, including:

- **Histograms and Box Plots** for distribution analysis.
- **Scatter Plots** to show relationships between key variables.
- **Bar Charts** to compare categorical variables.
- **Heatmaps** to visualize correlations among multiple features.
